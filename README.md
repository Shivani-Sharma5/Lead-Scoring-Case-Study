## Problem Statement ❓
X Education, a company specializing in online courses for industry professionals, faces a challenge with a low lead conversion rate of around 30%. Despite attracting many professionals to their website daily through various marketing channels such as Google and other websites, the conversion rate remains poor. On average, if 100 leads are acquired in a day, only about 30 convert into paying customers.

The company aims to improve this conversion rate by identifying 'Hot Leads' - leads with a higher likelihood of converting into paying customers. By focusing on these high-potential leads, the sales team can increase the efficiency of their efforts and achieve a higher overall conversion rate.

## Business Challenge 📝
To address this issue, we developed a logistic regression model to score leads, aiming to identify and prioritize those with a higher likelihood of conversion. This aligns with the CEO’s goal of achieving an 80% conversion rate.

## Objective 📋
To build a logistic regression model to predict the probability of each lead converting into a customer, thereby enabling X Education to focus efforts on the most promising leads. The model will assign a lead score between 0 and 100, where a higher score indicates a higher likelihood of conversion.

## Data 🛢️
The provided dataset contains around 9,000 data points, including attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, and Last Activity. The target variable, 'Converted', indicates whether a lead was converted (1) or not (0).
## Goal of the Study 🎯
1. Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, helping the company target potential leads more effectively.
2. Ensure the model can adapt to future changes in the company's requirements, as outlined in additional documentation.
3. Include findings and recommendations in a final presentation to guide the company's lead conversion strategy.
